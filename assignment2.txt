 
1.Declaration: The variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding scope.
•	You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword: ... After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).
Example  
  
            declaration:   
 
              var x;


2.Initialization: When you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine.
•	So undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.
Example  
              initialization: 
 
               x = 5;


3.Defining/definition of a function means the function simply names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
.              simply its giving a name to a function and specifying what the function is to do when called.
Example 
            square(5);
          :console.log(square(5));

          function square(n) { return n * n; }


4.Assignment: This is when a specific value is assigned to the variable.
Operator Example	Same As
-=	x -= y	      x = x - y
*=	x *= y	      x = x * y
/=	x /= y	      x = x / y
%=	x %= y	      x = x % y
