 
1.	Declaration: The variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding scope.
•	You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword: ... After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).


2.	Initialization: When you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine.
•	So undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.

3.	Assignment: This is when a specific value is assigned to the variable.
Operator Example	Same As
-=	x -= y	      x = x - y
*=	x *= y	      x = x * y
/=	x /= y	      x = x / y
%=	x %= y	      x = x % y
