DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDEFINED AND NULL.
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value;
 On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. 

Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, 
Examples:
                   such as: var TestVar; alert (TestVar); //shows undefined alert (typeof TestVar); //shows undefined.

In the first implementation of JavaScript, JavaScript values were represented as a type tag and a value, 
with the type tag for objects being 0, and null was represented as the NULL pointer (0x00 on most platforms). 
As a result, null had 0 as a type tag, hence the bogus typeof return value (reference).

                        null !== undefined but null == undefined.
